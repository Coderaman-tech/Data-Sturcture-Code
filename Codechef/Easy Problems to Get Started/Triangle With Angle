You're given the three angles a, b, and c respectively. Now check if these three angles can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0 or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if it can form a valid triangle with an area greater than 0, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Input:
First-line will contain three numbers a, b, and c separated by space.
Output:
Print "YES"(without quotes) if these sides can form a valid triangle, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints
0≤a,b,c≤180

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a,b,c;
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    int sum=a+b+c;
    if(sum==180 && a > 0 && b > 0 && c > 0)
    cout<<"YES";
    else
    cout<<"NO";
	// your code goes here
	return 0;
}
