You're given a number N. If N is divisible by 5 or 11 but not both then print "ONE"(without quotes). If N is divisible by both 5 and 11 then print "BOTH"(without quotes). If N is not divisible by 5 or 11 then print "NONE"(without quotes).

Input:
First-line will contain the number N.
Output:
Print the answer in a newline.

Constraints
1≤N≤103
Sample Input 1:
50
Sample Output 1:
ONE
Sample Input 2:
110
Sample Output 2:
BOTH
Sample Input 2:
16
Sample Output 2:
NONE
EXPLANATION:
In the first example, 50 is divisible by 5, but not 11.
In the second example, 110 is divisible by both 5 and 11.
In the third example, 16 is not divisible by 5 or 11.
